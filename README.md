# msh - A Unix Shell

msh is a small shell for use on Unix and Unix-like systems. It has been
tested on GNU/Linux (Debian) and FreeBSD.

msh can be built with a supported C compiler (currently gcc and clang).
Additionally, the shell needs the editline library on the system in order
to successfully build.

On BSD systems, there is currently an issue with getting the shell
compiled with gcc. If this occurs, the shell can be compiled using
the Clang compiler.

msh currently supports command input, I/O redirection, pipelining, filename
completion, and command history.

Future improvements may include:

* Tab completion (currently, only file completion is supported)
* Scripting support
* Network pipes

## Building

To build the code on Linux-based systems, just run

`make`

This will generate an executable named `msh`.

**Note:** If you are not using the gcc compiler, or are on a BSD-based
system, you can compile msh using the following command:

`make CC=clang`
